# Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to forecast product sales using historical sales data. We use machine learning techniques to analyze factors such as advertising spend, customer segmentation, and promotions to predict future sales. The goal is to build a model that helps businesses optimize marketing strategies for sales growth.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- **Sales**: The actual sales figure we aim to predict.
- **Advertising Spend**: The amount spent on advertising.
- **Customer Segment**: The segment of customers (e.g., age group, demographics).
- **Promotions**: Whether there was a promotional event.
- Additional features as required by your dataset.

## Steps Involved

### 1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
We start by loading the dataset and performing initial exploration to understand the structure of the data and check for missing values.

```python
df = pd.read_csv(r'path_to_your_sales_data.csv')
print(df.head())  # View first few rows of the dataset

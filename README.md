# 📊 Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 🧠 Overview
This project forecasts future product sales using historical data and machine learning techniques. The goal is to assist businesses in optimizing their marketing and promotional strategies to drive higher sales.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw sales dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with all the code from preprocessing to evaluation.
- `visuals/`: Graphs and charts generated from analysis.
- `models/`: (Optional) Saved ML models for reuse.

## 📌 Features Used
- Advertisement Spend
- Previous Sales
- Promotion (Yes/No)
- Season
- Sales (Target)

## 🚀 Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding, scaling.
2. **Model Training**: Linear Regression and Random Forest.
3. **Evaluation**: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R² metrics.
4. **Visualization**: Comparative bar and line charts for insights.

## 📊 Model Comparison
| Metric | Linear Regression | Random Forest |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| MSE    | *XX.XX*           | *XX.XX*        |
| RMSE   | *XX.XX*           | *XX.XX*        |
| MAE    | *XX.XX*           | *XX.XX*        |
| R²     | *XX.XX*           | *XX.XX*        |
